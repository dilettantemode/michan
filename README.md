## Setup private key

Use base64 from the private key, eg:
base64 -w0 id_rsa.pem > id_rsa.b64    # -w0 to avoid wrapping


## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

Development mode (with ts-node):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in the `PORT` environment variable).

Visit `http://localhost:3000/health` to see the "ok" response.
